\title{K-Fold train test sampling}
\usage{
k_fold(df, model_formula, k = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe containing the dataset to be split.}

\item{model_formula}{Model formula specifying the predictors and outcome variable.}

\item{k}{Integer value representing the number of folds. Defaults to 10.}
}
\description{
Splits a dataframe into train and test dataframes for model evaluation. Prepared data include data objects for xgboost.
}
\details{
This function performs k-fold cross-validation by splitting the input dataframe into k folds. 
Each fold serves as a test set once,while the remaining k-1 folds form the training set.

The function prepares data objects for xgboost model training and evaluation,including train/test datasets and xgboost DMatrix objects.

The output is a list containing the following elements:
-`f`: List of train and test datasets for each fold.
-`index`: Vector of fold indices.
-`model_formula`: Model formula used for generating the datasets.
-`variables`: Names of the variables in the model formula.
-`predictors`: Names of the predictor variables.
-`outcome`: Name of the outcome variable.
-`xgb`: List of xgboost DMatrix objects for training and testing.
