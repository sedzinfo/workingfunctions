# Compute Wilcoxon Effect Size

Computes the Wilcoxon rank-sum/signed-rank effect size r = abs(Z) /
sqrt(N), with Z derived from the p-value of stats::wilcox.test (Z =
qnorm(p / 2, lower.tail = FALSE)). This avoids a dependency on
rstatix/coin, using only stats::wilcox.test under the hood. The effect
size magnitude is computed from the two-sided p-value regardless of the
alternative used for the underlying hypothesis test.

## Usage

``` r
compute_wilcoxon_effect_size(
  formula,
  data,
  mu = 0,
  exact = NULL,
  correct = TRUE,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- formula:

  a formula of the form dv ~ group, same as used by stats::wilcox.test's
  formula method. Note: as with stats::wilcox.test's formula method,
  paired tests are not supported here; use stats::wilcox.test(x, y,
  paired = TRUE) directly for that case.

- data:

  data frame containing the variables in formula, same as
  stats::wilcox.test's data argument.

- mu:

  a number specifying an optional shift, same as stats::wilcox.test.

- exact:

  logical indicating whether an exact p-value should be computed, same
  as stats::wilcox.test.

- correct:

  logical indicating whether to apply the continuity correction, same as
  stats::wilcox.test.

- ...:

  additional arguments passed to stats::wilcox.test.

## Value

A single numeric value, the Wilcoxon effect size (r).

## Examples

``` r
compute_wilcoxon_effect_size(
  formula = bp_before ~ agegrp,
  data = df_blood_pressure[df_blood_pressure$agegrp %in% c("30-45", "46-59"), ]
)
#> [1] 0.1425689
rstatix::wilcox_effsize(bp_before ~ agegrp,
  data = df_blood_pressure[df_blood_pressure$agegrp %in% c("30-45", "46-59"), ]
)
