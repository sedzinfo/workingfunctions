# Normality diagnostic plots (histogram, density, boxplot, Q-Q)

For each numeric column of `df`, produces a 2×2 panel of base-graphics
normality diagnostics: histogram, density curve, boxplot, and Q-Q plot
with a reference line. A progress bar is printed to the console. When
`file` is supplied the panels are also written to a PDF via
[`report_pdf`](https://sedzinfo.github.io/rwf/reference/report_pdf.md).

## Usage

``` r
plot_normality_diagnostics(
  df,
  breaks = NULL,
  title = "",
  file = NULL,
  w = 10,
  h = 10,
  pb = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  Data frame or numeric vector. Non-numeric columns are silently
  dropped. Columns with fewer than three non-missing values or zero
  variance are skipped.

- breaks:

  Histogram breaks passed to
  [`hist`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/hist.html). May be a method name
  (`"Sturges"`, `"Scott"`, `"FD"`) or a positive integer specifying the
  number of bins. Default is `"Sturges"`.

- title:

  Character string used as the outer plot title and as the PDF title.
  Default is `""`.

- file:

  Character string naming the output PDF file (without extension). When
  `NULL` (default) no PDF is written.

- w:

  Width of the PDF in inches. Default is `10`.

- h:

  Height of the PDF in inches. Default is `10`.

- pb:

  Logical; whether to display a progress bar in the console. Default is
  `FALSE`.

## Value

A named list of recorded plots (one element per numeric column),
returned invisibly. Each element is a
[`recordPlot`](https://rdrr.io/r/grDevices/recordplot.html) object.

## Examples

``` r
vector <- generate_missing(rnorm(1000), missing = 10)
df <- generate_missing(mtcars[, 1:2], missing = 10)
plot_normality_diagnostics(df = vector, file = "rnorm", breaks = 30)

plot_normality_diagnostics(df = vector)

plot_normality_diagnostics(df = df, title = "mtcars")


plot_normality_diagnostics(df = df, title = "mtcars", pb = TRUE)
