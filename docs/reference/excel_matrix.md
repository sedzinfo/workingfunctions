# Write a matrix or data frame to an Excel worksheet with optional conditional formatting

Creates a new worksheet in an openxlsx workbook, writes the data, and
applies formatting via
[`excel_generic_format`](https://sedzinfo.github.io/rwf/reference/excel_generic_format.md).
Optionally adds a red-yellow-green colour scale for value ranges and
highlights the diagonal cells in red, which is useful for correlation
matrices.

## Usage

``` r
excel_matrix(
  df,
  workbook,
  sheet = "output",
  title = NULL,
  comment = NULL,
  numFmt = "#0.00",
  conditional_formatting = FALSE,
  diagonal = FALSE,
  diagonal_length = nrow(df)
)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  A data frame or matrix whose structure determines column formatting.
  Integer columns receive whole-number formatting; non-integer numeric
  columns receive the format specified by `numFmt`.

- workbook:

  An openxlsx workbook object created with
  [`openxlsx::createWorkbook()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/openxlsx/man/createWorkbook.html).

- sheet:

  Character. Name of the worksheet to format. Must already exist in
  `workbook`. Default is `"output"`.

- title:

  Character or `NULL`. If provided, written as a hidden comment on cell
  A1. Default is `NULL`.

- comment:

  A named list or `NULL`. Each name should match a column name in `df`;
  the value is the comment text added to that column's header cell.
  Names not found in `df` are silently ignored. Default is `NULL`.

- numFmt:

  Character. Excel number format string applied to non-integer numeric
  columns. Default is `"#0.00"`.

- conditional_formatting:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, applies a red-yellow-green colour scale to all
  data cells, where low values are red, mid values yellow, and high
  values green. Default is `FALSE`.

- diagonal:

  Logical. If `TRUE`, fills diagonal cells with a red background. Only
  applied when the data frame is square (`nrow == ncol`). Default is
  `FALSE`.

- diagonal_length:

  Integer. Number of diagonal cells to highlight when `diagonal = TRUE`.
  Defaults to `nrow(df)`.

## Value

Called for its side effects. Adds a formatted worksheet to `workbook`;
returns `NULL` invisibly.

## Details

Unlike
[`excel_generic_format`](https://sedzinfo.github.io/rwf/reference/excel_generic_format.md),
this function creates the worksheet and writes the data internally — do
not call `addWorksheet()` or `writeData()` beforehand.

The diagonal highlight is skipped silently for non-square data frames.
