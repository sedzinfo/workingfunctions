# Plot Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve

Generates a ROC curve from observed outcomes and predicted
probabilities.

## Usage

``` r
plot_roc(observed, predicted, base_size = 10, title = "")
```

## Arguments

- observed:

  Vector of observed outcomes. These are the true class labels.

- predicted:

  Vector of predicted outcome probabilities. These are the predicted
  probabilities for the positive class.

- base_size:

  Integer value representing the base font size for the plot. Defaults
  to 10.

- title:

  String representing the title of the plot. Defaults to an empty
  string.

## Details

This function generates a ROC curve to evaluate the performance of a
binary classification model. The ROC curve is a plot of the true
positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various
threshold settings.

The function performs the following steps: 1. Computes the ROC curve and
its confidence interval using \`pROC::roc\`. 2. Generates ROC plots for
both reversed and non-reversed order of class levels. 3. Creates a list
of ROC plots,each with an AUC value,control level,and direction.

The output is a list of ggplot objects representing the ROC curves for
different class level orders.

## Examples

``` r
# Example with random observed and predicted values
observed<-round(abs(rnorm(100,m=0,sd=0.5)))
predicted<-abs(rnorm(100,m=0,sd=0.5))
plot_roc(observed=observed,predicted=predicted)
#> $`1, 0`

#> 
#> $`0, 1`

#> 

# Example with generated correlation matrix
df1<-data.frame(matrix(0.999,ncol=2,nrow=2))
correlation_matrix<-as.matrix(df1)
diag(correlation_matrix)<-1
df1<-generate_correlation_matrix(correlation_matrix,nrows=1000)
df1$X1<-ifelse(abs(df1$X1) < 1,0,1)
df1$X2<-abs(df1$X2)
df1$X2<-(df1$X2-min(df1$X2))/(max(df1$X2)-min(df1$X2))
plot_roc(observed=round(abs(df1$X1),0),predicted=abs(df1$X2))
#> $`1, 0`

#> 
#> $`0, 1`

#> 
```
