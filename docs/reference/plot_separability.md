# Plot separability

This function creates a separability plot showing the density
distribution of predicted probabilities for different observed
categories.

## Usage

``` r
plot_separability(observed, predicted, base_size = 10, title = "")
```

## Arguments

- observed:

  Vector of observed outcomes. This can be numeric or factor values
  representing the true class labels.

- predicted:

  Vector of predicted outcome probabilities. This should have the same
  length as the observed vector and represent the predicted
  probabilities.

- base_size:

  Integer value representing the base font size for the plot. Defaults
  to 10.

- title:

  String representing the title of the plot. Defaults to an empty
  string.

## Details

This function generates a separability plot using ggplot2. It shows the
density distribution of predicted probabilities for different observed
categories. The plot helps to visualize how well the predicted
probabilities separate the different observed categories.

The plot includes the following components: -Density curves for each
observed category,representing the distribution of predicted
probabilities. -A legend indicating the observed categories. -The total
number of observations is included in the plot caption.

## Examples

``` r
# Example with numeric class labels
df1<-data.frame(matrix(.999,ncol=2,nrow=2))
correlation_matrix<-as.matrix(df1)
diag(correlation_matrix)<-1
df1<-generate_correlation_matrix(correlation_matrix,nrows=1000)
df1$X1<-ifelse(abs(df1$X1) < 1,0,1)
df1$X2<-abs(df1$X2)
df1$X2<-(df1$X2-min(df1$X2))/(max(df1$X2)-min(df1$X2))
plot_separability(observed=round(abs(df1$X1),0),predicted=abs(df1$X2))
```
