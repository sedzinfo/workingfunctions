# Autocorrelation, autocovariance, and partial autocorrelation plot

Produces a faceted ggplot2 chart showing the autocorrelation function
(ACF), autocovariance function, and partial autocorrelation function
(PACF) of a time series side by side. Each facet includes dashed 95%
confidence interval lines computed from the distribution of the ACF
values, making it easy to identify significant lags and seasonal
patterns. Missing values are excluded via
`na.action = stats::na.exclude`.

## Usage

``` r
plot_acf(df, lag.max = length(df), base_size = 10, title = "")
```

## Arguments

- df:

  A `ts` object containing the time series to analyse.

- lag.max:

  Integer specifying the maximum number of lags to compute. Default is
  `length(df)` (all possible lags).

- base_size:

  Base font size passed to `theme_bw()`. Default is `10`.

- title:

  Character string used as the plot title. Default is `""`.

## Value

A `ggplot` object with three free-scale facets:

- Correlation:

  Autocorrelation function — measures linear dependence between the
  series and its own lagged values.

- Covariance:

  Autocovariance function — the un-normalised version of the ACF.

- Partial.Correlation:

  Partial autocorrelation function — correlation at each lag after
  removing the effect of shorter lags, useful for identifying AR model
  order.

Each facet includes dashed horizontal lines for the 95% CI lower bound
(blue), mean (black), and upper bound (blue).

## Examples

``` r
ts_data<-ts(UKDriverDeaths,start=1969,end=1984,frequency=12)
plot_acf(df=ts_data,base_size=20)
```
