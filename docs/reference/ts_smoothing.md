# Time series smoothing with multiple bandwidth levels

Plots a time series and overlays a family of smoothed curves using a
chosen smoothing method. For bandwidth-based methods (`"kernel"`,
`"lowess"`, `"splines"`, `"default"`), a sequence of bandwidth or span
values from `start` to `stop` is swept and each curve is drawn in a
different rainbow colour, making it easy to visually select an
appropriate smoothing level. `"polynomial"` and `"linear"` ignore the
bandwidth sequence and fit regression-based trend lines instead. The
function uses base R graphics and produces a plot as a side effect.

## Usage

``` r
ts_smoothing(
  df,
  start = 0.01,
  stop = 2,
  step = 0.001,
  title = "",
  type = "kernel"
)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  A `ts` object containing the time series to smooth.

- start:

  Numeric. Starting value of the bandwidth or span sequence. Default is
  `0.01`.

- stop:

  Numeric. Ending value of the bandwidth or span sequence. Default is
  `2`.

- step:

  Numeric. Increment between bandwidth values. Smaller values produce
  more curves. Default is `0.001`.

- title:

  Character string appended to the plot title. Default is `""`.

- type:

  Character string specifying the smoothing method. One of:

  `"kernel"`

  :   Gaussian kernel smoother via
      [`ksmooth()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/ksmooth.html) — bandwidth
      controls the smoothing window (default).

  `"lowess"`

  :   Locally weighted regression via
      [`lowess()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lowess.html) — `f` controls
      the span proportion.

  `"friedman"`

  :   Friedman's super-smoother via
      [`supsmu()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/supsmu.html) — span must be
      in (0, 1).

  `"splines"`

  :   Smoothing splines via
      [`smooth.spline()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/smooth.spline.html) —
      `spar` controls the penalty.

  `"default"`

  :   Running mean filter via
      [`filter()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/filter.html) — bandwidth
      rounded to an integer window width.

  `"polynomial"`

  :   Fits a centred cubic polynomial trend with and without seasonal
      (cos/sin) terms via [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html).

  `"linear"`

  :   Fits a simple linear trend via
      [`lm()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html) and draws the regression
      line.

## Value

Invisibly returns `NULL`. The function is called for its side effect of
producing a base R plot.

## Examples

``` r
ts_data <- ts(UKDriverDeaths, start = 1969, end = 1984, frequency = 12)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
ts_smoothing(ts_data,
  start = .01, stop = 2, step = .01,
  title = "Driver Deaths in UK", type = "default"
)
ts_smoothing(ts_data,
  start = .01, stop = 2, step = .01,
  title = "Driver Deaths in UK", type = "polynomial"
)
ts_smoothing(ts_data,
  start = .01, stop = 2, step = .01,
  title = "Driver Deaths in UK", type = "linear"
)
ts_smoothing(ts_data,
  start = .01, stop = 2, step = .01,
  title = "Driver Deaths in UK", type = "kernel"
)

ts_smoothing(ts_data,
  start = .01, stop = 2, step = .01,
  title = "Driver Deaths in UK", type = "lowess"
)
ts_smoothing(ts_data,
  start = .01, stop = 2, step = .01,
  title = "Driver Deaths in UK", type = "friedman"
)
ts_smoothing(ts_data,
  start = .01, stop = 2, step = .01,
  title = "Driver Deaths in UK", type = "splines"
)
```
