In psychological trait theory, the Big Five personality traits, also
known as the five-factor model (FFM) and the OCEAN model, is a suggested
taxonomy, or grouping, for personality traits, developed from the 1980s
onwards. When factor analysis (a statistical technique) is applied to
personality survey data, some words used to describe aspects of
personality are often applied to the same person. For example, someone
described as conscientious is more likely to be described as "always
prepared" rather than "messy". This theory is based therefore on
semantic associations between words and not on neuropsychological
experiments. This theory uses descriptors of common language and
suggests five broad dimensions commonly used to describe the human
personality and psyche.

The theory identifies five factors:

- **Openness to experience (O)** (inventive/curious vs.
  consistent/cautious)

- **Conscientiousness (C)** (efficient/organized vs.
  extravagant/careless)

- **Extraversion (E)** (outgoing/energetic vs. solitary/reserved)

- **Agreeableness (A)** (friendly/compassionate vs. challenging/callous)

- **Neuroticism (N)** (sensitive/nervous vs. resilient/confident)

The five factors are represented using the acronyms OCEAN or CANOE.
Beneath each proposed global factor, there are a number of correlated
and more specific primary factors. For example, extroversion is
typically associated with qualities such as gregariousness,
assertiveness, excitement-seeking, warmth, activity, and positive
emotions. Family life and the way someone was raised will affect these
traits. Twin studies and other research have shown that about half of
the variation between individuals results from their genetics and half
from their environments. Researchers have found conscientiousness,
extroversion, openness to experience, and neuroticism to be relatively
stable from childhood through adulthood.

Items are grouped by Big Five traits:

- **Extraversion (E)**: E1 to E10

- **Neuroticism (N)**: N1 to N10

- **Agreeableness (A)**: A1 to A10

- **Conscientiousness (C)**: C1 to C10

- **Openness (O)**: O1 to O10

Negatively keyed items are: E2, E4, E6, E8, E10, N2, N4, A1, A3, A5, A7,
C2, C4, C6, C8, O2, O4, O6. These should be reverse-coded prior to
scoring.
