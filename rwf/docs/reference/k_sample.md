# Train test sampling

Splits a dataframe into train and test dataframes for model evaluation.
Prepared data include data objects for xgboost.

## Usage

``` r
k_sample(df, model_formula, k = 1)
```

## Arguments

- df:

  Dataframe containing the dataset to be split.

- model_formula:

  Model formula specifying the predictors and outcome variable.

- k:

  Integer value representing the number of folds. Defaults to 1
  (train-test split).

## Details

This function performs k-fold cross-validation or a simple train-test
split (if k=1) by splitting the input dataframe into k folds. Each fold
serves as a test set once,while the remaining k-1 folds form the
training set.

The function prepares data objects for xgboost model training and
evaluation,including train,test,and validation datasets and xgboost
DMatrix objects.

The output is a list containing the following elements: -\`f\`: List of
train,test,and validation datasets for each fold. -\`index\`: Vector of
fold indices. -\`model_formula\`: Model formula used for generating the
datasets. -\`variables\`: Names of the variables in the model formula.
-\`predictors\`: Names of the predictor variables. -\`outcome\`: Name of
the outcome variable. -\`xgb\`: List of xgboost DMatrix objects for
training,testing,and validation.
